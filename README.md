# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

This source code is for the credit card fraud detection using machine learning algorithm. 
Using a dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud.In this project , two machine learning algorithm is used-
    - Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
    - Isolation Forest Algorithm
    
Furthermore, using metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores, we will investigate why the classification accuracy for these algorithms can be misleading.

In addition, we are exploring the use of data visualization techniques common in data science, such as parameter histograms and correlation matrices, to gain a better understanding of the underlying distribution of data in our data set.
